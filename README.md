# MC Trade Post
=======

## Description

This mod extends the MineColonies mod.  It, and it's dependencies, are required for MC Trade Post to function.

MC Trade Post introduces an economic system which allows the selling of excess items for Minecash (â€¡). These accounts can be used for a variety of purposes, such as bribing raiders to leave the town alone, and unlocking additional upgrades and features.  

### In-Game How-To

Craft a Marketplace hut. Using the build tool, choose the "Economics" style from the MC Trade Post mod, and contruct the Marketplace as you would any other hut. Interactions for the MC Trade Post mod are handled primarily in the Marketplace interface on that hut block.  

### Custom Items

Marketplace Hut - Supports the Marketplace building and the Shopkeeper job.  
Advanced Clipboard - Just like the regular clipboard but with a button that filters the outstanding needs down to only those expected to be fulfilled by a player.  

### Custom Blocks

Marketplace Hut Block - Block implementation of the item above.  

## Installation

Download the appropriate mctradepost-x.y.z.jar file from Github at the root project directory.  
Copy that Jar file into your mods directory.  
Note that MineColonies and its dependencies must be present to work.  

### Compatibility Reference

mctradepost-0.0.4 -> MineColonies 1.1.950 (Minecraft 1.21.1)  

## Building Design Reference
### Marketplace
The marketplace building should have two item frames or glowing item frames for each level of the building.
These frames should be mounted in empty (air) blocks tagged with the "display_shelf" tag.  (Apply the tag to a placeholder item, then remove that placeholder and put the frame in.)


## Current Status

This mod can best be described as a "pre-alpha" state. It functionality may change rapidly and without warning.

### Roadmap (Roughly Prioritized)

Interface for spending earned income.  
- Unlock subsequent levels of the merchant building  
- Summon traders  
- Add trader recipes  
Happiness based on colony wealth per citizen  
Leisure time / resorts / vacations (Resort hut w/custom needs items; travel agency hut)  
Huts to allow skill-up in non-primary/secondary stats.  
Pet shops, pet functions, pet-related colony roles.  
Assembling colonies into collections (empire, state, etc.)  
Express shipping (intracolony and inter-colony) - faster item transport. Faster people transport.  

### Complete

Marketplace implementation for selling items.
