MC Trade Post
=======
*Description*
This mod extends the MineColonies mod.  It, and it's dependencies, are required for MC Trade Post to function.

MC Trade Post introduces an economic system which allows the selling of excess items for Minecash (â€¡). These accounts can be used for a variety of purposes, such as bribing raiders to leave the town alone, and unlocking additional upgrades and features.

*How-To*
Craft a Marketplace hut. Using the build tool, choose the Economics style, and contruct the Marketplace as you would any other hut. Interactions for the MC Trade Post mod are handled primarily in the Marketplace interface on that hut block.

*Current Status*
This mod can best be described as a "pre-alpha" state. It functionality may change rapidly and without warning.

*Roadmap*
Interface for spending earned income.
- Unlock subsequent levels of the merchant building
- Summon traders
